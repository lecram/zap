#summary zap programming Tutorial.

= Introduction =

This tutorial is intended for programmers who want to learn the basics of zap.

You will need to [Build build zap] from sources in order to run zap programs on your computer.

= Hello World =

A zap script is a source code file with instructions for execution by the zap interpreter. As a simple example, let's create a file called "hello.z" containing the following text:

{{{
print("Hello, World!\n")
}}}

This script invokes the `print()` function, causing the interpreter to show a message on the console. In this example, the message is specified by a string literal. The characters `\n` at the end of the string indicate a line break.

== Compiling and Running ==

To run this program we must first compile the file "hello.z" using the compiler "compile.py":

{{{
% python compile.py hello.z
Compiling "hello.z"...
OK.
%
}}}

This operation will generate a file "hello.zbc" which can then be executed by the zap interpreter:

{{{
% zap hello.zbc
Hello, World!
%
}}}
